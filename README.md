<h1>My Favorite Anime Series Is <strong><em>"ONE PIECE"</em></strong></h1>

One Piece is a popular Japanese anime and manga series created by Eiichiro Oda. It follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a young pirate with the ability to stretch his body like rubber after eating a supernatural fruit called the Gum-Gum Fruit. Luffy assembles a diverse crew of pirates known as the Straw Hat Pirates and together they embark on a journey across the vast oceans of the fictional world in search of the ultimate treasure known as the "One Piece."
